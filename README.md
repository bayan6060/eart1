# E-ART
E-ART is a lightwight encryption algorithm that used the reflection property of a balanced binary search tree data structure to minimize the overhead, 
and on the other hand, a dynamic offset to achieve a high security level. In this project, The performance and security of the proposed algorithm were compared to 
Advanced Encryption Standard and Data Encryption Standard symmetric encryption algorithms.
E-ART achieved the lowest running time with comparable memory usage

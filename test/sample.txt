This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he stateshis maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 
MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are normal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 
negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.

Dear Dr. Gordon:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.

His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.  We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.  He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.  However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.  He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.

Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.  The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.  The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.

In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.  However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.  I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.  In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.  Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.  Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.  

I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.  If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Swanson:

I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.  He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.  He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.  Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.  He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.  

He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.  His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.  He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.  He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

Sincerely,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.  Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.  We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.  Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.

He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.  He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.  He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.  It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.  His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.  His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.  His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.  His lung fields are clear.  He has no cardiac murmur.  There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.

His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.  In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.  It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.  We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.

He will continue his efforts at weight loss.  He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and

discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says

yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old

gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling

Foley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he

has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were

told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased

POs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He

then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more

awake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his

baseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest

pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers

or chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has

abdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,

hypertension, CHF.

Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at

a nursing home.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no

distress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure

102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse

upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular

rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is

nontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,

no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower

extremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.

The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his

urinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. 

Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the

lab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no

longer drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. 

Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were

unsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,

the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology

evaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI

and/or abscess.

LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs

within normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,

hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal

limits.  UA again is pending at this time.

He will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the

patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the

WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I

am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and

urology evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.
